# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project uses React, TypeScript, and Vite for a fast development. It also includes ESLint for static code analysis to catch errors and problematic patterns in the code. In addition, Prettier is integrated to enforce a consistent code style.

## Quick Start

To get the project up and running in development mode, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open the application in your default browser.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate static files in the `dist` folder.

## Linting

To check code quality with ESLint, run:

```sh
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues, use:

```sh
npm run lint:fix
```

## Testing

To run tests with Jest, use:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Main Dependencies

- React for building the user interface.
